# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

While the webpage loaded fine and looked to be ok it was not in working order.
I reviewed the HTML and CSS and corrected the following:
- Changed the title and fixed the broken link for HTML
- Removed footer as it did not follow the mock up
- Revised CSS to avoid redundancy 


## Usage - COMING SOON
