# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

While the webpage loaded fine and looked to be ok it was not in working order.
I reviewed the HTML and CSS and corrected the following:
- Changed the title and fixed the broken link for HTML
- Removed footer as it did not follow the mock up
- Revised CSS to avoid redundancy 


## Usage - COMING SOON

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
