# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

While the webpage loaded fine and looked to be ok it was not in working order.
I reviewed the HTML and CSS and corrected the following:
- Changed the title and added header in html
- Cleaned up lines of code and fixed the broken link
- Removed footer as it did not follow the mock up
- Revised CSS to avoid redundancy 
- What I learned in this challenge was to take each step line by line, instead of being overwhelmed at the project as a whole.
